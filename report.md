# Project Overview

My programs implement the Producer-Consumer problem with POSIX threads, shared memory, and synchronization mechanisms like mutex locks. It uses conditions for both of the producer and consumer processes' critical sections, and access is coordinated with the mutex locks and condition variables to ensure race conditions are avoided and mutual exclusion is enforced.

# Step-by-Step

## Compilation

To compile, run:

```C++
g++ producer.cpp -o producer -pthread
g++ consumer.cpp -o consumer -pthread
```

## Execution

To execute, run:

```C++
./producer & ./consumer &
```

# Example

Here is what a typical output that's generated by running both program looks like. This output demonstrates the behavior of the producer and consumer as they enter and exit the critical section, as well as the 2 programs/processes waiting when the buffer is full or empty.

Producer: Entered..
Produced: 1
Producer: Just Exiting...
Consumer waiting... Buffer is empty.
Producer: Entered..
Produced: 2
Producer: Just Exiting...
Producer waiting... Buffer is full.
Consumer: Entered..
Consumed: 1
Consumer: Just Exiting...
Producer: Entered..
Produced: 3
Producer: Just Exiting...
Consumer: Entered..
Consumed: 2
Consumer: Just Exiting...
Producer waiting... Buffer is full.
Consumer: Entered..
Consumed: 3
Consumer: Just Exiting...

## Example Output Explanation

Producer: 
    **Entered.."** – Indicates that the producer entered its critical section.
    **"Produced: <item>"**– Shows that the producer has generated an item, adding it to the buffer/shared memory.
    **"Producer: Just Exiting..."** – Indicates the producer has finished adding the item and is leaving its critical section.
    **"Producer waiting... Buffer is full."** – Shows that the producer is paused because the buffer has reached its maximum capacity (2 items in this case).

Consumer: 
    **"Consumer waiting... Buffer is empty."** – Indicates that the consumer is waiting for an item to be produced since the buffer is empty.
    **"Consumer: Entered.."** – Indicates that the consumer has entered its critical section.
    **"Consumed: <item>"** – Shows that the consumer has removed an item from the buffer.
    **"Consumer: Just Exiting..."** – Indicates the consumer has finished processing the item and is leaving its critical section.

## Execution Summary

The output confirms that the producer and consumer are correctly synchronized, because the producer pauses when the buffer is full, and the consumer pauses when the buffer is empty. 
The producer and consumer both respect the lock on the shared buffer, ensuring mutual exclusion and preventing data races. The condition variables (buffer_not_empty and buffer_not_full) correctly handle the waiting and signaling to maintain buffer capacity constraints.

# Conclusion

The threading and synchronization logic has been correctly implemented, and my project showcases a relatively straightforward solution to the classic Producer-Consumer problem.
